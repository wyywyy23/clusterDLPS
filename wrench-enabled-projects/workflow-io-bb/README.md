# Simulator for running scientific workflows on burst buffers architectures
The repository contains everything to reproduce the results of our paper: _Modeling the Performance of Scientific Workflow Executions on HPC Platforms with Burst Buffers_

Note that, to reproduce the papers you will need a NERSC allocation (to use Cori) and an ORNL allocation to use Summit.
However, you do not need those to reproduce the simulations.

To have more details instructions, navigate in the repo.
