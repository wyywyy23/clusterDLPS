# Data

## Traces
Traces folder contains the traces recorded, the measured data from the experiments.
For now, it contains only experiments executed on Cori.
In the directory `/data/traces/swarp/shared-cori`, you can find different CSV used for the paper.
As the raw data are too big for GitHub, we publish the CSV.

## Workflows
The workflow folder contains several `.dax` files representing workflows that can be used as input by the simulator

## Platforms
The platform folder contains `.xml` files representing the different platform with burst buffers you can use and simulate (right now, only Cori)
